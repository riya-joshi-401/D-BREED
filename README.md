# D-BREED
A web-app made using flask and Deep learning ( custom CNN model with InceptionResNetV2 ) in python for identifying the breed of the dog from its image.
<br>
<ins><b>File descriptions:</b></ins>
<li> train.zip - the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs</li>
<li> test.zip - the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image </li>
<li> sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format </li>
<li> labels.csv - the breeds for the images in the train set </li>
<li> The train folder consists of 10,222 images and test folder consists of 10,357 images.</li>
<li> Each image has a filename that is its unique id. </li>
<li> The dataset comprises of 120 breeds of dogs. </li>
<br>
<ins><b>Accuracy achieved after training the model:</b></ins>  91.0959%
